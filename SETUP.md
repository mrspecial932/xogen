# Quick Setup Guide

## üöÄ 5-Minute Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm run install:all
```

This installs dependencies for both frontend and backend.

### 2. Configure Backend Email

Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory:

```bash
cd backend
```

Create `.env` file with the following content:
```env
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
PORT=5000
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
```

### 3. Get Gmail App Password

1. Go to https://myaccount.google.com/security
2. Enable 2-Step Verification if not already enabled
3. Go to https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
4. Select "Mail" and generate a password
5. Copy the 16-character password
6. Use it as `EMAIL_PASS` in your `.env` file

### 4. Run the Application

```bash
cd ..  # Go back to root
npm run dev:all
```

This starts:
- Frontend on http://localhost:5173
- Backend on http://localhost:5000

### 5. Test the Application

1. Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser
2. Navigate to the Contact page
