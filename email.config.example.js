// Copy this file to .env in the root directory and add your credentials
/*
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
PORT=5000

IMPORTANT: 
For Gmail, you need to use an "App Password" instead of your regular password
1. Enable 2-factor authentication on your Gmail account
2. Go to https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
3. Generate an app password for "Mail"
4. Use that generated password as EMAIL_PASS

For other email providers (Outlook, Yahoo, etc.), check their documentation
for SMTP settings and app-specific passwords
